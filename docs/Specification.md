# MCP Server and Tools Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the design and functionality of the MCP server, CLI tools, API, and web-based management interfaces to facilitate efficient server configuration, tool management, and integration into various projects.

## Key Components
### 1. **MCP Server**
- **Features:**
  - Serves as a centralized hub for managing tool configurations.
  - Supports multiple servers running simultaneously on different ports.
  - Operates via a JSON configuration file (`assets/mcp/` or any custom directory).
- **Configuration Options (JSON Example):**
  ```json
  {
    "server": {
      "name": "MCP Server",
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 8080,
      "maxClients": 50
    },
    "protocol": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "modelContext": true,
      "requestTimeout": 30000,
      "encoding": "UTF-8"
    },
    "logging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "logLevel": "INFO",
      "logFile": "logs/mcp-server.log"
    },
    "authentication": {
      "enabled": true,
      "authType": "token",
      "tokenValidity": 3600
    },
    "endpoints": {
      "registerClient": "/api/register",
      "sendMessage": "/api/message",
      "getStatus": "/api/status"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. **CLI Tool (`oarc-mcp`)**
- **Commands:**
  - `oarc-mcp serve`:
    - Starts the MCP server in a separate CPU thread to avoid blocking the console.
  - `oarc-mcp stop`:
    - Terminates a running MCP server by looking up the process ID (PID) and process name.
  - `oarc-mcp add <project_dir>`:
    - Integrates MCP configuration into a specified project directory.
  - `oarc-mcp mcpify`:
    - Automatically identifies tools in a project directory by analyzing the local GitHub repository using a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Supports tool editing via an integrated `ToolEditor`.

### 3. **Web-Based Admin Panel**
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Features:**
  - Graphical interface for managing multiple MCP servers.
  - Real-time status updates and logs.
  - Tool management: Add, edit, remove tools from projects.

## Use Cases
### 1. **Tool Integration**
   - MCP configuration files (`assets/mcp/`) inform project workspaces how to interact with MCP tools. 
   - Allows developers to "MCPify" any project with minimal effort.

### 2. **Multi-Server Management**
   - Run multiple MCP servers efficiently for different projects or environments.
   - Each server maintains its configuration and operates independently.

### 3. **Scalable and Modular Design**
   - The system is designed to work like a language server for TypeScript or other custom languages in VS Code.
   - Developers can extend the MCP framework into their workflows easily.

### 4. **Enhanced Usability**
   - CLI commands are intuitive and versatile, reducing setup time.
   - The Next.js admin panel offers a user-friendly interface for non-CLI users.

## Future Enhancements
- **API Integration:**
  - Build a REST API to allow external systems to interact with MCP servers programmatically.
- **Real-Time Visualization:**
  - Add monitoring dashboards to the admin panel for performance metrics and client connections.
- **Tool Recommendations:**
  - Use AI to analyze GitHub repositories and recommend tools or configurations automatically.
- **Extended Authentication:**
  - Add support for OAuth and multi-factor authentication.

## Implementation Timeline
1. Develop CLI commands (`oarc-mcp`).
2. Integrate MCP server configuration and process management.
3. Build the Next.js admin panel with multi-server support.
4. Test scalability with multiple servers and complex configurations.
5. Roll out AI-powered enhancements for tool discovery and management.
